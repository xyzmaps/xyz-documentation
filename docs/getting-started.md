## Non-Developers

If you do not want to code to make a map or store your data, have a look at **[XYZ Studio](https://xyzmaps.github.io/xyz-studio**. No coding required.

## Developers

To use XYZ Maps Hub as a developer you need a couple of things that we'll explain below. 

Next you probably want to have more control over what your doing. You can install
**[XYZ CLI](cli/index.md)** to drive a lot of things right from your commandline.

If you are building a web application and want to show a map with your data have a look at our
**[XYZ Maps JavaScript](ui/index.md)** as it was built to show and style Space data on a map.

To integrate Data Hub data features into a mobile, web or server application you can make
REST calls to the **[XYZ Hub APIs](api/index.md)** to work with data directly.
