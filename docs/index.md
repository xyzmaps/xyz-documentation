!!! success "Open Source forking and cleaning in progress"

    This documentation is currently being updated to reflect the fork and resulting changes
    in moving to a **free and open source version of XYZ Maps**. 
    
    That means all references to proprietary
    links, APIs and authentication are removed and where possible redirected to an open version.
    Also a lot of the marketing speak and terminology will be cleaned.

    While this is going on, links might be broken and command described in the documentation
    might not work or work differently. Stay tuned!


## Make great maps easier and faster

XYZ Maps is an open, interoperable and real-time location data management service 
that offers simple APIs, SDKs, components, and interactive tools
that enable everyone to make maps easier and faster.

At its core XYZ Maps is a collection of tools and APIs to enable everyone to easily
manage map data and build great maps. It is built around standards like
[GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) and designed to be **open** and **interoperable**
with many other offerings. Most important of all, HERE Data Hub offers
real-time **live** interaction with location data.

## Quick start

The easiest way to get started is to have a look at the easy to use **[XYZ Maps Studio](https://xyzmaps.github.io/xyz-studio/)** web application to build and publish maps. Give it a try, it's completely free and open to use for everyone - you can host and run it yourself, no account or credentials needed.

When you have a GeoJSON file you just want to have a look at without building a full map, check out our **[GeoJSON Tool](cli/viewer-tool/index.md)** tool. It's a great way to inspect data you'd want to work with.

If you are a developer see our **[getting started guide](getting-started.md)** for more details.

Then, install the latest version of the XYZ Maps CLI with `npm`:

``` sh
npm install -g xyzmaps-cli
```

## What to expect

* Powerful **map data management** and **display tools** that make working with
  map data convenient and effective. The tools are easy to understand even if
  you have no prior experience with geospatial, location or projections concepts.

* A free **self-hosted service** to store and access data for your maps with
  straightforward **RESTful API** calls and a flexible **CLI**. The choice
  is yours. 

* **UI components** that make it easy to **show and style data** and content exactly how
  you want to see it. It works well with huge amounts of data and also enables
  **rich interactive** and **real-time** experiences.

For detailed instructions on the prerequisites see our **[getting started guide](getting-started.md)**.
