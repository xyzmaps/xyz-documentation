# Group By in CSV Files

CSV is a flat file format, but the rows often contain hierarchical data associated with a particular region or place. A few examples include election results, census statistics, or time-series data. If more than one row of your CSV contains an ID for the same place, you can use `xyzmaps space upload --groupby` or `xyzmaps space join groupby` to nest the values of a column as unique properties within a single feature. You can then use Virtual Spaces to join the data to existing geometries on the fly.

- `--groupby columnName` consolidates multiple rows of a CSV that share a unique ID into a single feature (designated with `-i` (usually representing a admin geography)); values in each row within that selected column will be grouped as nested properties within an object named after the column in the consolidated feature properties.
- `--groupby` can be used with `upload` or the `join` command to extract the hierarchy from a CSV and upload it to a space without geometries.

### upload vs join

- with `join`, the data is uploaded and the virtual space with the geometry space is created in one step.
- `upload --groupby` is useful for updating the "data space" in a virtual space that has already been created. It can also be used to upload the grouped data before a virtual space has created with a space containing geometries matching geoIDs using `xyzmaps space vs -a`

### When to use groupby

This is a complex feature and is best explained by example.

Imagine a CSV of election results where each row contains a precinct ID, candidate name, political party, and that party's percentage of the vote. Since there are multiple candidates running for office in each precinct, there would be multiple rows containing the same precinct ID, which is what we would need to join this data to precinct geometries on a map using virtual spaces.

    precinct,candidate,party,vote_percentage
    1,Baker,Red,30
    1,Farmer,Blue,60
    1,Fisher,Green,10
    2,Woods,Red,60
    2,Waters,Blue,10
    2,Rivers,Green,30

However, if we tried to upload this CSV using `-i precinct`, XYZ Maps would consider each new feature with that unique ID to be an update of the existing feature, which is not what we want.

Using `group_by`, we can designate `precinct` as the feature ID, and select the values of `party` to be the nested object. This would generate geojson similar to this

    {
      id: 1,
      geometry: null
      properties: {
        party: {
          Red: {
            candidate: Baker
            vote_percentage: 30
          },
          Blue: {
            candidate: Farmer
            vote_percentage: 60
          },
          Green: {
            candidate: Fisher
            vote_percentage: 10
          }
        }
      },
    {
      id: 2,
      geometry: null
      properties: {
        party: {
          Red: {
            candidate: Woods
            vote_percentage: 60
          },
          Blue: {
            candidate: Waters
            vote_percentage: 10
          },
          Green: {
            candidate: Rivers
            vote_percentage: 30
          }
        }
      }

This "data space" has no geometries, but using virtual spaces, it is simple to merge it on the fly with a second space that contains the precinct geometries with the same set of feature IDs.

You can upload and merge this CSV two ways, using `upload` or `join`.

    xyzmaps space upload -f http://elections.xyz/results.csv -i precinct --groupby party --noCoords 
    xyzmaps space vs -a csvSpace,geometrySpace

or

    xyzmaps space join precinctGeometrySpace -f http://elections.xyz/results.csv -i precinctID --groupby party --noCoords 

This uploads the CSV into a space where the results for each precinct are consolidated in a GeoJSON feature with no geometry, and the results for each candidate / political party would be nested within a `party` object. With virtual spaces, these are easily merged with a space containing the precinct geometries with the same feature ID. The virtual space ID can then be visualized in a variety of mapping tools. More importantly, the space containing the nested CSV data can be updated each time it is updated by election officials using the `xyzmaps space upload` command specified above, avoiding the work involved in a manual join with a large, nationwide set of geometries.

You can try this yourself with [this CSV of election results from the 2019 Canadian Federal Election](data/2019_canadian_federal_election_results.csv) and the shared XYZ Maps space `mo3sLwE3`, which contains polygons of Canadian electoral precincts.

    xyzmaps space join mo3sLwE3 -f https://github.com/heremaps/xyz-documentation/raw/master/docs/cli/tutorials/data/2019_canadian_federal_election_results.csv -i District --groupby party
    
### --promote
    
There may be fields that you do not want to be nested in each sub-object -- a good example here is the name of the district. You can use `--promote` to keep those properties from being unnecessarily nested.

```xyzmaps space join mo3sLwE3 -f https://github.com/heremaps/xyz-documentation/raw/master/docs/cli/tutorials/data/2019_canadian_federal_election_results.csv -i District --groupby party --promote "District Name","Nom de Circonscription"```

### --flatten

Nested objects have advantages and disadvantages. If your tools suffer from `Object object` you can use `--flatten` save the groups as individual properties where the names are simple strings, rather than nested objects, but still preserve the hierarchy using colons:

      "properties": {
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:Given name - Prénom": "Richard",
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:Appartenance politique": "Parti Rhinocéros Party",
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:Surname - Nom de famille": "Plett",
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:Votes obtained - Votes obtenus": 109,
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:% Votes obtained - Votes obtenus %": 0.2,
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:Rejected ballots - Bulletins rejetés***": 489,
        "party:Parti Rhinocéros Party:Total number of ballots cast - Nombre total de votes déposés": 53438,
        "party:Liberal:Given name - Prénom": "Bruno",
        "party:Liberal:Appartenance politique": "Libéral",
        "party:Liberal:Surname - Nom de famille": "Uggenti",
        "party:Liberal:Votes obtained - Votes obtenus": 16057,
        "party:Liberal:% Votes obtained - Votes obtenus %": 30.3,
        "party:Liberal:Rejected ballots - Bulletins rejetés***": 489,
        "party:Liberal:Total number of ballots cast - Nombre total de votes déposés": 53438...

vs

```
      "properties": {
        "party": {
          "Liberal": {
            "Type of results*": "validated",
            "Given name - Prénom": "Bruno",
            "Type de résultats**": "validés",
            "Appartenance politique": "Libéral",
            "Surname - Nom de famille": "Uggenti",
            "Votes obtained - Votes obtenus": 16057,
            "% Votes obtained - Votes obtenus %": 30.3,
            "Rejected ballots - Bulletins rejetés***": 489,
            "Total number of ballots cast - Nombre total de votes déposés": 53438
          },
          "Parti Rhinocéros Party": {
            "Given name - Prénom": "Richard",
            "Appartenance politique": "Parti Rhinocéros Party",
            "Surname - Nom de famille": "Plett",
            "Votes obtained - Votes obtenus": 109,
            "% Votes obtained - Votes obtenus %": 0.2,
            "Rejected ballots - Bulletins rejetés***": 489,
            "Total number of ballots cast - Nombre total de votes déposés": 53438
          }...
```

Another example is COVID-19 data from the Covid Tracking project API.

    xyzmaps space join xkRyxQl9 -f https://covidtracking.com/api/v1/states/daily.csv --noCoords -i state --groupby date

This will merge daily state testing data from March 2020 until today into a virtual space with xkRyxQl9, a shared space with US state geometries. 

Note that it is not recommended to use streaming / `-s` with `groupby` -- attempting simultaneous writes to the same property of the same feature can lead to potential API errors.
